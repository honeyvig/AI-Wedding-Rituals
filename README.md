# AI-Wedding-Rituals
Creating a Python program that simulates the wedding rituals of various religions (including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Taoism, Shintoism, and others) with mantras, hymns, sacred chants, and AI-powered humanoid robotics for real-time execution of the rituals is a highly ambitious project. This involves integrating a variety of technologies such as:

    Textual data from sacred books (e.g., Vedas, Bible, Quran, Guru Granth Sahib, Tao Te Ching).
    Mantras, hymns, chants from these religious texts.
    AI and NLP models (Large Language Models - LLMs) to interpret, generate, and speak these rituals.
    Humanoid Robotics to physically perform the rituals, guided by AI.
    Real-time integration using sensors, speech synthesis, and gesture recognition.

High-Level Approach

We need to break the task into the following steps:

    Sacred Text Parsing: Extracting rituals, hymns, and mantras from the respective sacred books.
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Using LLMs (such as GPT) to understand and generate context-specific rituals.
    Speech Synthesis: Using AI to speak the mantras and hymns.
    Robotic Control: Using humanoid robotics (controlled by AI) to physically perform the rituals.
    Real-Time Interaction: Integrating sensors and AI to ensure real-time adjustments and personalization.

Tech Stack

    NLP Models (LLMs): GPT-4, BERT, or custom-trained models for religious text interpretation.
    Speech Synthesis: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems like Google TTS, Amazon Polly, or custom AI models.
    Robotic Control: Humanoid robots like Sophia or Pepper.
    AI Tools: Python libraries for AI control (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers).
    Sensors & Robotics: Tools like ROS (Robot Operating System) for controlling robots.
    Audio Libraries: For playing or generating the sound of mantras, hymns, and sacred chants.

Example Python Program

Hereâ€™s an example of how such a system could be implemented. Please note that this code will be a simulation and won't interface directly with physical robots, but it will simulate the key components such as generating chants, speaking them, and interpreting rituals in real time.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

pip install transformers pyttsx3 tensorflow openai soundfile opencv-python

Step 2: Python Code Implementation

import pyttsx3
import time
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import numpy as np
import openai

# Initialize speech synthesis engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Load LLM (GPT-2 for now)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# OpenAI GPT-3 for more complex ritual interpretation (requires API key)
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# Sacred text data (for simplicity, we'll use a small selection of sacred texts)
hindu_mantras = [
    "Om Namah Shivaya", "Gayatri Mantra", "Om Mani Padme Hum"
]

christian_hymns = [
    "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.",
    "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me."
]

quran_verses = [
    "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful).",
    "Alhamdulillahi rabbil 'alamin (Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds)."
]

sikh_gurbani = [
    "Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.",
    "Jap Ji Sahib"
]

tao_mantras = [
    "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.",
    "Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom."
]

shinto_prayers = [
    "Kami-sama, please guide us with your wisdom.",
    "We offer our prayers to the kami of the shrine."
]

def generate_ritual_instructions(ritual_prompt):
    # Using GPT-3 to generate ritual instructions
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=ritual_prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

def perform_ritual(ritual_data):
    for line in ritual_data:
        speak_mantra(line)
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate waiting between rituals

# Simulate a wedding ceremony using a mix of sacred texts
def wedding_ceremony():
    print("Performing wedding rituals...")

    # Hindu Wedding Rituals
    print("Performing Hindu wedding ritual...")
    perform_ritual(hindu_mantras)
    
    # Christian Wedding Hymn
    print("Performing Christian wedding hymn...")
    perform_ritual(christian_hymns)
    
    # Quranic Verses
    print("Reciting Quranic verses...")
    perform_ritual(quran_verses)
    
    # Sikh Prayers (Gurbani)
    print("Reciting Sikh prayers (Gurbani)...")
    perform_ritual(sikh_gurbani)

    print("Reciting Taoist mantras...")
    perform_ritual(tao_mantras)

# Example Usage of GPT-3 to generate a personalized wedding ritual
def generate_personalized_wedding():
    wedding_prompt = """
    You are an AI priest performing a wedding ceremony. Include blessings, vows, and rituals from Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Taoism, and Shintoism in a way that respects the sacredness of each tradition.
    """
    ritual_instructions = generate_ritual_instructions(wedding_prompt)
    print("Generated Ritual Instructions:")
    print(ritual_instructions)
    speak_mantra(ritual_instructions)

# Main function to perform the rituals and also simulate the AI robot interaction
def main():
    # Start the ceremony

    # Generate a personalized wedding ritual using GPT-3
    generate_personalized_wedding()

    main()

Code Breakdown:

    Textual Resources (Sacred Texts):
        A small set of mantras, hymns, and prayers from Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Taoism, and Shintoism are stored as lists. These can be expanded with more texts from each religion.

    Speech Synthesis:
        The pyttsx3 library is used for text-to-speech (TTS). Each mantra or prayer is spoken aloud, simulating the ritual's vocal component.

    Ritual Generation Using GPT-3:
        GPT-3 is used to generate custom wedding rituals based on a prompt. You can provide GPT-3 with a detailed request to customize the ceremony with various traditions, and it will return an interpretation or set of instructions.

    Performing the Ritual:
        The perform_ritual() function simulates the progression of a wedding ceremony by speaking the mantras and hymns in sequence with pauses between them. This simulates the pacing of a real-world ceremony.

    Personalized Wedding:
        The generate_personalized_wedding() function uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to create a unique wedding ritual based on multiple religious traditions.

    Humanoid Robotics:
        In this program, the humanoid robotics part is simulated by generating the ritual in text and speech. For real-world implementation, humanoid robots such as Sophia or Pepper could be controlled using robotic systems like ROS (Robot Operating System). The humanoid robots would be programmed to perform specific gestures or actions that align with the rituals, like offering the wedding fire or making hand gestures in prayer.

    Real-Time Interaction:
        The program uses time.sleep(2) to simulate real-time pauses during the ritual. This ensures the flow of the ceremony mimics the real-life pauses that would happen as each step is performed.

Future Enhancements:

    Real Robotic Control: Integrating the program with robotic systems (e.g., using ROS to control humanoid robots like Pepper or Sophia) to physically enact the ritual actions.
    Advanced Speech Generation: Using more sophisticated TTS systems like Google Cloud TTS or Amazon Polly for better speech quality.
    Real-Time Personalization: Adding more personalization to the rituals, like recognizing the couple's names and customizing vows and blessings using AI.

Conclusion:

This program simulates a wedding ceremony using sacred texts and AI for ritual performance. It integrates AI (GPT-3) for real-time generation of personalized wedding rituals and speech synthesis for delivering mantras, hymns, and prayers. For real-world implementation, humanoid robots could be used to physically perform the rituals, guided by AI models and robot control systems like ROS. This type of system would require further integration with sensor feedback, robotic gesture recognition, and AI-based real-time adaptations for a fully immersive experience.
